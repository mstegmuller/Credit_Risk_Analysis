# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to predict whether someone is high or low risk credit status using the loans_stats.csv data.  The project used scikit-learn library to create models to predict credit risk.  Using the data we created various modules.  The modules used were random over sampling, SMOTE oversampling, Under-sampling, Combination of over and under-sampling, Balance random forest classifier, and Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier.   

Results

Summary

The over-sampling, under-sampling. SMOTE over-sampling, and combination of oversampling modules tried to predict which loans were high risk.  The accuracy score was not high on these modules.  The Easy Ensemble Adaboost Classifier had the best accuracy score.  I would recommend this module.
